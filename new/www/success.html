  * The "meta viewport" tag (below) helps your app size appropriately to a device's screen.
  * Note that the meta viewport approach is being phased out in favor of the @viewport CSS rule.
  * For a quick overview of both, see this article:
  *   http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag
  * To see what happens, try the app on a real device with and without a "meta viewport" tag.

                            <p>The fun part in my GCIC years were immeasurable. The academic hardships were compensated by numerous recreational activities organized by our dedicated professors. These types of activities cultivated our hidden talents that could have been hidden for the rest of our lives if not encouraged. We appreciated ourselves and others as well as we get to know them better in activities involving the whole class and groups (houses). College like high school is where you find new friends that would make your college journey easier. I developed good friendships not just with my classmates but also with my professors. It was indeed a very fulfilling experience to be a part of GCIC employed with devoted faculty.
 
I will forever carry and implement the leadership, excellence and innovation that my Alma Mater has nurtured in me.</p>
