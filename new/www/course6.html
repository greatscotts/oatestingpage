With the advancement and breakthroughs in the medical field, there is a growing demand for trained individuals in medical testing laboratories to make proper diagnostics. In the US and Canada where there is a shortage of medical technologists, the Filipino medical technologist has an advantage, given his ability to work with people of different ethnicities. In addition, the similarity in health system makes medical technologists trained in the Philippines comfortable in US laboratories. Medical technologists provide essential clinical information to health care providers and are responsible for assuring reliable results that contribute to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of various medical conditions. Laboratory  tests are extremely valuable and contribute to majority of medical decisions made by healthcare professionals.
