  * The "meta viewport" tag (below) helps your app size appropriately to a device's screen.
  * Note that the meta viewport approach is being phased out in favor of the @viewport CSS rule.

  *   http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag
  * To see what happens, try the app on a real device with and without a "meta viewport" tag.
