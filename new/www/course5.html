  * The "meta viewport" tag (below) helps your app size appropriately to a device's screen.
  * Note that the meta viewport approach is being phased out in favor of the @viewport CSS rule.
  * For a quick overview of both, see this article:
  *   http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag
  * To see what happens, try the app on a real device with and without a "meta viewport" tag.

While investigators in the US TV series Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) examine crime scenes and search for clues to crack mysteries, do you know that you can do the same as an accountant in forensic accounting? Find solutions to crime by detecting and preventing embezzlement, tax evasion, and money laundering.</p>
