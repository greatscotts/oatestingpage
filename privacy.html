         <h4 style="margin-left:10px;margin-right:17px;" >This application and website is owned and operated by OrangeApps Inc. ("we", "our", or "us" or the "Company"). We understand you value your privacy. We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This privacy policy (the "Policy") governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this application (the "Application") and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information. Our policies may differ from other service offerings and you should carefully review the terms of service and this privacy notice before using these services.
<br><br>
Collected Information
In general, you can visit the Application without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. If you choose to register, and are 13 years of age or older, we will collect your name, date of birth, email address, and street address along with other billing and shipping addresses ("Dedit Card Information"). By providing your Personal Information to us, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this Policy.
<br><br>
If you request to receive company or product information, or request information about specific Services, or provide comments about Services, you will be asked to provide contact information so that we can complete your request. We use this App Information to fulfill your request. We may also use this App Information to send you additional information about our Services or Courses on the App that you may be interested in.
<br><br>
Some of the Services require that you become a registered user and create a user account. This will require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, that may include (but not be limited to) your (and if you are enrolling as part of our Khawna for Enterprises program) your company’s name, e-mail address, as well as telephone and address information.
You allow us to use this personally identifiable App Information to register you to use the Services, enroll in Courses, and otherwise provide you with the Services; verify your authority to enter the Site and access the Courses and Services; notify you of updates; improve the content and general administration of the App and the Services; provide you with notices regarding the Services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future.
You also consent to our providing this personally identifiable information to Instructors as part of the Course Information when you enroll in a Course. Instructors will use this Course Information to provide the Course to you. Instructors may have other users for Course Information. It is your responsibility when you enroll in a Course to confirm what uses the Instructor will make of your personally identifiable Course Information. Khawna does not control these uses by Instructors.
<br><br>
Other Information We Collect and How We Use It
Khawna may also automatically collect and analyze App Information about your general usage of the App, Services and Courses. We might track your usage patterns to see what features of the App, Services and Courses you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system, and statistical information about how you use the Services and Courses. We only collect, track and analyze such Site Information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you. This aggregate data may be used to assist us in operating the Site and the Services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of the Services, and improve their Course offerings, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable data.
<br><br>
Instructors may collect non-personally identifiable Course Information in connection with your participation in Courses. This Course Information may include, but not be limited to, your interaction with the Instructor and other Users, comments you leave on Course forums, answers or essays you submit to satisfy Course requirements, and so forth. As noted above, it is your responsibility to review the Instructor’s policy in connection with all Course Information and decide whether or not you want to provide such Course Information.
